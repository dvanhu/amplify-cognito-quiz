## 📦 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- It correctly bundles React in production mode.
- Optimizes the build for best performance.
- The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!  
More info on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> ⚠️ **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

This command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project.  
It gives you full control over tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.
